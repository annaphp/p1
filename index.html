	<p>
		Hi my name is Anna and I am from Canada. I am new to the web development industry,
		and	I am very passionate about it and looking forward to learn as much as possible.
		I am at the begging of my career as a web developer and I am planning on
		taking more courses at Harvard Extension School.
	</p>
	<h4> Why are you taking this course?</h4>
	<p>
		I am taking CSCEI 15 because I want to learn how to build dynamic web applications,
		improve my HTML and CSS skills and learn PHP.
	</p>
	<h4> What previous experience do you have with programming?</h4>
	<p>
		I have taken CSCI E-10A and 10B where I learned foundational concepts of
		Computer Science using Java and Unix. I have also learned basic data
		structures, recursion, iteration, inheritance, polymorphism and etc.
	</p>
	<h4> Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h4>
